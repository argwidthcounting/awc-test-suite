.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR
[\fIoption\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR
is a program that automates the process of building a Debian package. It
consists of the following steps:
.IP "\fB1.\fR" 4
.IX Item "1."
It prepares the build environment by setting various environment
variables (see \fB\s-1ENVIRONMENT\s0\fR), runs the \fBinit\fR hook, and calls
\&\fBdpkg-source \-\-before\-build\fR (unless \fB\-T\fR or \fB\-\-target\fR
has been used).
.IP "\fB2.\fR" 4
.IX Item "2."
It checks that the build-dependencies and build-conflicts
are satisfied (unless \fB\-d\fR or \fB\-\-no\-check\-builddeps\fR is specified).
.IP "\fB3.\fR" 4
.IX Item "3."
If one or more specific targets have been selected with the \fB\-T\fR or
\&\fB\-\-target\fR option, it calls those targets and stops here. Otherwise it
runs the \fBpreclean\fR hook and calls \fBfakeroot debian/rules clean\fR to
clean the build-tree (unless \fB\-nc\fR or \fB\-\-no\-pre\-clean\fR
is specified).
.IP "\fB4.\fR" 4
.IX Item "4."
It runs the \fBsource\fR hook and calls \fBdpkg-source \-b\fR to generate
the source package (if a \fBsource\fR build has been requested with
\&\fB\-\-build\fR or equivalent options).
.IP "\fB5.\fR" 4
.IX Item "5."
It runs the \fBbuild\fR hook and calls \fBdebian/rules\fR \fIbuild-target\fR,
then runs the \fBbinary\fR hook followed by \fBfakeroot debian/rules\fR
\&\fIbinary-target\fR (unless a source-only build has been requested with
\&\fB\-\-build=source\fR or equivalent options).
Note that \fIbuild-target\fR and \fIbinary-target\fR are either \fBbuild\fR
and \fBbinary\fR (default case, or if an \fBany\fR and \fBall\fR build
has been requested with \fB\-\-build\fR or equivalent options), or
\&\fBbuild-arch\fR and \fBbinary-arch\fR (if an \fBany\fR and not \fBall\fR
build has been requested with \fB\-\-build\fR or equivalent options), or
\&\fBbuild-indep\fR and \fBbinary-indep\fR (if an \fBall\fR and not \fBany\fR
build has been requested with \fB\-\-build\fR or equivalent options).
.IP "\fB6.\fR" 4
.IX Item "6."
It runs the \fBbuildinfo\fR
hook and calls \fBdpkg-genbuildinfo\fR to generate a \fB.buildinfo\fR file.
Several \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR options are forwarded to
\&\fBdpkg-genbuildinfo\fR.
.IP "\fB7.\fR" 4
.IX Item "7."
It runs the \fBchanges\fR hook and calls \fBdpkg-genchanges\fR to
generate a \fB.changes\fR file.
The name of the \fB.changes\fR file will depend on the type of build and
will be as specific as necessary but not more;
for a build that includes \fBany\fR the name will be
\&\fIsource-name\fR\fB_\fR\fIbinary-version\fR\fB_\fR\fIarch\fR\fB.changes\fR,
or otherwise for a build that includes \fBall\fR the name will be
\&\fIsource-name\fR\fB_\fR\fIbinary-version\fR\fB_\fR\fBall.changes\fR,
or otherwise for a build that includes \fBsource\fR the name will be
\&\fIsource-name\fR\fB_\fR\fIsource-version\fR\fB_\fR\fBsource.changes\fR.
Many \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR options are forwarded to
\&\fBdpkg-genchanges\fR.
.IP "\fB8.\fR" 4
.IX Item "8."
It runs the \fBpostclean\fR hook and if \fB\-tc\fR or \fB\-\-post\-clean\fR
is specified, it will call \fBfakeroot debian/rules clean\fR again.
.IP "\fB9.\fR" 4
.IX Item "9."
It calls \fBdpkg-source \-\-after\-build\fR.
.IP "\fB10.\fR" 4
.IX Item "10."
It runs the \fBcheck\fR hook and calls a package checker for the
\&\fB.changes\fR file (if a command is specified in \fB\s-1DEB_CHECK_COMMAND\s0\fR or
with \fB\-\-check\-command\fR).
.IP "\fB11.\fR" 4
.IX Item "11."
It runs the \fBsign\fR hook and calls \fBgpg\fR (as long as it
is not an \s-1UNRELEASED\s0 build, or \fB\-\-no\-sign\fR is specified) to sign the
\&\fB.dsc\fR file (if any, unless
\&\fB\-us\fR or \fB\-\-unsigned\-source\fR is specified), the \fB.buildinfo\fR
file (unless \fB\-ui\fR, \fB\-\-unsigned\-buildinfo\fR,
\&\fB\-uc\fR or \fB\-\-unsigned\-changes\fR is specified) and
the \fB.changes\fR file (unless \fB\-uc\fR or \fB\-\-unsigned\-changes\fR
is specified).
.IP "\fB12.\fR" 4
.IX Item "12."
It runs the \fBdone\fR hook.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
All long options can be specified both on the command line and in the
\&\fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR system and user configuration files.
Each line in the configuration file is either an option (exactly the same
as the command line option but without leading hyphens) or a comment (if
it starts with a \(oq\fB#\fR\(cq).
.IP "\fB\-\-build=\fR\fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "--build=type"
Specifies the build \fItype\fR from a comma-separated list of components
(since dpkg 1.18.5).
Passed to \fBdpkg-genchanges\fR.
.Sp
The allowed values are:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBsource\fR" 4
.IX Item "source"
Builds the source package.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR When using this value standalone and if what you want is simply to
(re\-)build the source package from a clean source tree, using
\&\fBdpkg-source\fR directly is always a better option as it does not
require any build dependencies to be installed which are otherwise
needed to be able to call the \fBclean\fR target.
.IP "\fBany\fR" 4
.IX Item "any"
Builds the architecture specific binary packages.
.IP "\fBall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Builds the architecture independent binary packages.
.IP "\fBbinary\fR" 4
.IX Item "binary"
Builds the architecture specific and independent binary packages.
This is an alias for \fBany,all\fR.
.IP "\fBfull\fR" 4
.IX Item "full"
Builds everything.
This is an alias for \fBsource,any,all\fR, and the same as the default
case when no build option is specified.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-build=source,all\fR (since dpkg 1.17.11).

.IX Item "-G"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-build=source,any\fR (since dpkg 1.17.11).
.IP "\fB\-b\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-build=binary\fR or \fB\-\-build=any,all\fR.

Equivalent to \fB\-\-build=any\fR.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-build=all\fR.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-build=source\fR.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-build=full\fR, \fB\-\-build=source,binary\fR or

.IP "\fB\-\-target=\fR\fItarget\fR[,...]" 4
.IX Item "--target=target[,...]"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-target\fR \fItarget\fR[,...]" 4
.IX Item "--target target[,...]"
.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-rules\-target=\fR\fItarget\fR[,...]" 4
.IX Item "-T, --rules-target=target[,...]"
.PD
Calls \fBdebian/rules\fR \fItarget\fR once per target specified, after
having setup the build environment (except for calling
\&\fBdpkg-source \-\-before\-build\fR), and stops the package build process
here (since dpkg 1.15.0, long option since dpkg 1.18.8, multi-target
support since dpkg 1.18.16).
If \fB\-\-as\-root\fR is also given, then the command is executed
as root (see \fB\-\-root\-command\fR).
Note that known targets that are required to
be run as root do not need this option (i.e. the \fBclean\fR, \fBbinary\fR,
\&\fBbinary-arch\fR and \fBbinary-indep\fR targets).
.IP "\fB\-\-as\-root\fR" 4
.IX Item "--as-root"
Only meaningful together with \fB\-\-target\fR (since dpkg 1.15.0).
Requires that the target be run with root rights.

.IX Item "-e, --build-by=maintainer-address"
.PD
Passed unchanged to \fBdpkg-genchanges\fR. See its manual page.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-host\-arch\fR \fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --host-arch architecture"
Specify the Debian architecture we build for (long option since dpkg 1.17.17).
The architecture of the
machine we build on is determined automatically, and is also the default
for the host machine.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-host\-type\fR \fIgnu-system-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t, --host-type gnu-system-type"
Specify the \s-1GNU\s0 system type we build for (long option since dpkg 1.17.17).
It can be used in place
of \fB\-\-host\-arch\fR or as a complement to override the default \s-1GNU\s0 system type
of the host Debian architecture.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-arch\fR \fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-arch architecture"
Specify the Debian architecture the binaries built will build for
(since dpkg 1.17.17).
The default value is the host machine.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-type\fR \fIgnu-system-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-type gnu-system-type"
Specify the \s-1GNU\s0 system type the binaries built will build for
(since dpkg 1.17.17).
It can be
used in place of \fB\-\-target\-arch\fR or as a complement to override the
default \s-1GNU\s0 system type of the target Debian architecture.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-build\-profiles=\fR\fIprofile\fR[\fB,\fR...]" 4
.IX Item "-P, --build-profiles=profile[,...]"
Specify the profile(s) we build, as a comma-separated list (since dpkg 1.17.2,
long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
The default
behavior is to build for no specific profile. Also sets them (as a space
separated list) as the \fB\s-1DEB_BUILD_PROFILES\s0\fR environment variable which
allows, for example, \fBdebian/rules\fR files to use this information for
conditional builds.
.IP "\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR[=\fIjobs\fR|\fBauto\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-j, --jobs[=jobs|auto]"
Number of jobs allowed to be run simultaneously, number of jobs matching
the number of online processors if \fBauto\fR is specified
(since dpkg 1.17.10), or unlimited number if \fIjobs\fR is not specified,
equivalent to the
\&\fBmake\fR(1)
option of the same name (since dpkg 1.14.7, long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
Will add itself to the \fB\s-1MAKEFLAGS\s0\fR
environment variable, which should cause all subsequent make
invocations to inherit the option, thus forcing the parallel setting on
the packaging (and possibly the upstream build system if that uses make)
regardless of their support for parallel builds, which might cause build
failures.
Also adds \fBparallel=\fR\fIjobs\fR or
\&\fBparallel\fR to the \fB\s-1DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS\s0\fR environment variable which
allows debian/rules files to use this information for their own purposes.
The \fB\-j\fR value will override the \fBparallel=\fR\fIjobs\fR or
\&\fBparallel\fR option in the \fB\s-1DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS\s0\fR environment variable.
Note that the \fBauto\fR value will get replaced by the actual number of
currently active processors, and as such will not get propagated to any
child process. If the number of online processors cannot be inferred then
the code will fallback to using serial execution (since dpkg 1.18.15),
although this should only happen on exotic and unsupported systems.
.IP "\fB\-J\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\-try\fR[=\fIjobs\fR|\fBauto\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-J, --jobs-try[=jobs|auto]"
This option (since dpkg 1.18.2, long option since dpkg 1.18.8) is equivalent
to the \fB\-j\fR option except that it does not set the \fB\s-1MAKEFLAGS\s0\fR
environment variable, and as such it is safer to use with any package
including those that are not parallel-build safe.
.Sp
\&\fBauto\fR is the default behavior (since dpkg 1.18.11). Setting the number
of jobs to 1 will restore a serial behavior.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-check\-builddeps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D, --check-builddeps"
Check build dependencies and conflicts; abort if unsatisfied (long option
since dpkg 1.18.8).
This is the default behavior.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-no\-check\-builddeps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --no-check-builddeps"
Do not check build dependencies and conflicts (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-builtin\-builddeps\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ignore-builtin-builddeps"
Do not check built-in build dependencies and conflicts (since dpkg 1.18.2).
These are the distribution specific implicit build dependencies usually
required in a build environment, the so called Build-Essential package set.
.IP "\fB\-\-rules\-requires\-root\fR" 4
.IX Item "--rules-requires-root"
Do not honor the \fBRules-Requires-Root\fR field, falling back to its
legacy default value (since dpkg 1.19.1).
.IP "\fB\-nc\fR, \fB\-\-no\-pre\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nc, --no-pre-clean"
Do not clean the source tree before building (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
Implies \fB\-b\fR if nothing else has been selected among \fB\-F\fR,
\&\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-G\fR, \fB\-B\fR, \fB\-A\fR or \fB\-S\fR.
Implies \fB\-d\fR with \fB\-S\fR (since dpkg 1.18.0).
.IP "\fB\-\-pre\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "--pre-clean"
Clean the source tree before building (since dpkg 1.18.8).
This is the default behavior.
.IP "\fB\-tc\fR, \fB\-\-post\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-tc, --post-clean"
Clean the source tree (using
\&\fIgain-root-command\fR
\&\fBdebian/rules clean\fR)
after the package has been built (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-post\-clean\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-post-clean"
Do not clean the source tree after the package has been built
(since dpkg 1.19.1).
This is the default behavior.
.IP "\fB\-\-sanitize\-env\fR" 4
.IX Item "--sanitize-env"
Sanitize the build environment (since dpkg 1.20.0).
This will reset or remove environment variables, umask, and any other process
attributes that might otherwise adversely affect the build of packages.
Because the official entry point to build packages is \fBdebian/rules\fR,
packages cannot rely on these settings being in place, and thus should work
even when they are not.
What to sanitize is vendor specific.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-root\-command=\fR\fIgain-root-command\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --root-command=gain-root-command"
When
\&\fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR
needs to execute part of the build process as root, it prefixes the
command it executes with
\&\fIgain-root-command\fR
if one has been specified (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
Otherwise, if none has been specified,
\&\fBfakeroot\fR will be used by default, if the command is present.
\&\fIgain-root-command\fR
should start with the name of a program on the
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR
and will get as arguments the name of the real command to run and the
arguments it should take.
\&\fIgain-root-command\fR
can include parameters (they must be space-separated) but no shell
metacharacters.
\&\fIgain-root-command\fR
might typically be
\&\fBfakeroot\fR, \fBsudo\fR, \fBsuper\fR or \fBreally\fR.
\&\fBsu\fR
is not suitable, since it can only invoke the user's shell with
\&\fB\-c\fR
instead of passing arguments individually to the command to be run.
.IP "\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-rules\-file=\fR\fIrules-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R, --rules-file=rules-file"
Building a Debian package usually involves invoking
\&\fBdebian/rules\fR
as a command with several standard parameters (since dpkg 1.14.17,
long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
With this option it's
possible to use another program invocation to build the package (it can
include space separated parameters).
Alternatively it can be used to execute the standard rules file with
another make program (for example by using
\&\fB/usr/local/bin/make \-f debian/rules\fR
as \fIrules-file\fR).
.IP "\fB\-\-check\-command=\fR\fIcheck-command\fR" 4
.IX Item "--check-command=check-command"
Command used to check the \fB.changes\fR file itself and any artifact built
referenced in the file (since dpkg 1.17.6).
The command should take the \fB.changes\fR pathname
as an argument. This command will usually be \fBlintian\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-check\-option=\fR\fIopt\fR" 4
.IX Item "--check-option=opt"
Pass option \fIopt\fR to the \fIcheck-command\fR specified with
\&\fB\s-1DEB_CHECK_COMMAND\s0\fR or \fB\-\-check\-command\fR (since dpkg 1.17.6).
Can be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-\-hook\-\fR\fIhook-name\fR\fB=\fR\fIhook-command\fR" 4
.IX Item "--hook-hook-name=hook-command"
Set the specified shell code \fIhook-command\fR as the hook \fIhook-name\fR,
which will run at the times specified in the run steps (since dpkg 1.17.6).
The hooks will
always be executed even if the following action is not performed (except
for the \fBbinary\fR hook).
All the hooks will run in the unpacked source directory.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR Hooks can affect the build process, and cause build failures if
their commands fail, so watch out for unintended consequences.
.Sp
The current \fIhook-name\fR supported are:
.Sp
\&\fBinit preclean source build binary buildinfo changes postclean check sign done\fR
.Sp
The \fIhook-command\fR supports the following substitution format string,
which will get applied to it before execution:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB%%\fR" 4
.IX Item "%%"
A single % character.
.IP "\fB\f(CB%a\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "%a"
A boolean value (0 or 1), representing whether the following action is
being performed.
.IP "\fB\f(CB%p\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "%p"
The source package name.
.IP "\fB\f(CB%v\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "%v"

.IP "\fB\-\-buildinfo\-file=\fR\fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--buildinfo-file=filename"
Set the \fIfilename\fR for the generated \fB.buildinfo\fR file (since dpkg 1.21.0).
.IP "\fB\-\-buildinfo\-option=\fR\fIopt\fR" 4
.IX Item "--buildinfo-option=opt"
Pass option \fIopt\fR to \fBdpkg-genbuildinfo\fR (since dpkg 1.18.11).
Can be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-sign\-command=\fR\fIsign-command\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, --sign-command=sign-command"
When \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR needs to execute \s-1GPG\s0 to sign a source
control (\fB.dsc\fR) file or a \fB.changes\fR file it will run
\&\fIsign-command\fR (searching the \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR if necessary) instead of
\&\fBgpg\fR (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
\&\fIsign-command\fR will get all the arguments
that \fBgpg\fR would have gotten. \fIsign-command\fR
should not contain spaces or any other shell metacharacters.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-sign\-key=\fR\fIkey-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k, --sign-key=key-id"
Specify a key-ID to use when signing packages (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
.IP "\fB\-us\fR, \fB\-\-unsigned\-source\fR" 4
.IX Item "-us, --unsigned-source"
Do not sign the source package (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
.IP "\fB\-ui\fR, \fB\-\-unsigned\-buildinfo\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ui, --unsigned-buildinfo"
Do not sign the \fB.buildinfo\fR file (since dpkg 1.18.19).
.IP "\fB\-uc\fR, \fB\-\-unsigned\-changes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-uc, --unsigned-changes"
Do not sign the \fB.buildinfo\fR and \fB.changes\fR files
(long option since dpkg 1.18.8).
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-sign"
Do not sign any file, this includes the source package, the \fB.buildinfo\fR
file and the \fB.changes\fR file (since dpkg 1.18.20).
.IP "\fB\-\-force\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "--force-sign"
Force the signing of the resulting files (since dpkg 1.17.0), regardless of
\&\fB\-us\fR, \fB\-\-unsigned\-source\fR,
\&\fB\-ui\fR, \fB\-\-unsigned\-buildinfo\fR,
\&\fB\-uc\fR, \fB\-\-unsigned\-changes\fR
or other internal heuristics.

.SS "Internal environment"
.IX Subsection "Internal environment"
Even if \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR exports some variables, \fBdebian/rules\fR
should not rely on their presence and should instead use the
respective interface to retrieve the needed values, because that
file is the main entry point to build packages and running it
standalone should be supported.

.SS "Default build targets"
.IX Subsection "Default build targets"
\&\fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR is using the \fBbuild-arch\fR and
\&\fBbuild-indep\fR targets since dpkg 1.16.2. Those targets are thus
mandatory. But to avoid breakages of existing packages, and ease
the transition, if the source package does not build both architecture
independent and dependent binary packages (since dpkg 1.18.8) it will
fallback to use the \fBbuild\fR target if \fBmake \-f debian/rules \-qn\fR
\&\fIbuild-target\fR returns 2 as exit code.
